# Discord Spam Removal Script

We often see in the Post Promotion channel of the Discord that people posts his posts more than once or more than one in 24 hours. So this script will automatically delete those posts if it finds duplicate or more than one in 24 hours.

To get started first create a Discord Bot, if you are not sure how to do it Check https://steemit.com/technology/@codingdefined/let-s-learn-how-to-create-a-discord-bot.

Then run this script which will create a Sqlite db if it does not exists and start getting the values from the Discord Channel.
